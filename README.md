### Project Goal
The goal of Mobile Scratchpad is to create an app where musicians can quickly compose sheet music
on the fly without having to worry about cumbersome interfaces. It fills a need for smaller
compositions on the phone, and will hopefully grow and develop with user feedback.

### Features
* Quick, on-the-go musical composition with touch-screen sheet music interface
* Pick from a variety of keys and rhythmic values
* Play your music using built-in MIDI playback
